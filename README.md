# Abstract

Used my own custom react-boiler to do a react test for Elder. 

I did not satisfy all of the requirements, I didn't see that Redux was listed as a requirement until I had already completed it, however, I have included a store I wrote for a project earlier if you'd like to check it out, I don't have time to go back and add state management tonight, I'm sorry.
